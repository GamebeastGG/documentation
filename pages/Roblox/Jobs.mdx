# Dashboard Jobs

Jobs are the actions that Gamebeast performs on your Roblox game servers. These actions can include publishing configurations, user management, and custom developer defined jobs. 

## Viewing Jobs
Jobs can be viewed in the Gamebeast dashboard under the "Jobs" tab. Here, you can see the status of each job, the time it was created, and the type of job it is.

When a job is created, it is placed in a queue and processed in the order it was received. For a job to be processed, there must be at least one active game server or studio instance in play mode with the Roblox SDK running.

## Custom Jobs
