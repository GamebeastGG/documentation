# Dashboard Jobs

Jobs are the actions that Gamebeast performs on your Roblox game servers. These actions can include publishing configurations, user management, and custom developer defined jobs. 

## Viewing Jobs
Jobs can be viewed in the Gamebeast dashboard under the "Jobs" tab. Here, you can see the status of each job, the time it was created, and the type of job it is.

When a job is created, it is placed in a queue and processed in the order it was received. For a job to be processed, there must be at least one active game server or studio instance in play mode with the Roblox SDK running.

### Job Statuses

Jobs can have the following statuses:

- **Queued**: The job is waiting to be processed.
- **Dispatched**: The job has been sent to a game server or studio instance.
- **Started**: The job has been started on a game server or studio instance.
- **Completed**: The job has been completed successfully.
- **Canceled**: The job was canceled by another job or the user.

It's common for these jobs to be processed in a matter of seconds, but the time it takes to process a job can vary depending on the complexity of the job, the number of jobs in the queue, and the "Request Process Frequency" configured in the project settings.
