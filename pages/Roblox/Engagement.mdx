# Engagement Markers

Markers are used to track player interactions and events in your experience. This data can be used to create heatmaps and other visualizations to help you understand how players are interacting with your experience.

To send markers to Gamebeast, you must first fetch the [`Markers`](/Roblox/API/Markers) service from the Gamebeast SDK. You can then use the provided `:SendMarker` methods to send markers to Gamebeast with your custom data.

By default, Gamebeast also sends a number of built-in markers to track generic player interactions, such as player joins, leaves, and chats.

## Types of markers

There are two types of markers you can send to Gamebeast, Player and Global markers. All of these marker types can be visualized through the [query builder](/Roblox/QueryBuilder).

### Player markers

Player markers are used to track player-specific interactions and events. These markers are tied to a specific player and can be used to track things like player fails, eliminations, and other player-specific events.

You can view markers sent with a specific player by navigating to the player's profile in the Gamebeast [user management](/Roblox/UserManagement) dashboard.

### Global markers

Global markers are used to track global interactions and events that are not tied to a specific player. These markers can be used to track things like game starts, game ends, and other global events.

## Default markers

Gamebeast automatically sends a number of built-in markers to track generic player interactions, such as player joins, leaves, and chats. These markers are sent without any additional configuration and can be viewed in the Gamebeast dashboard.

## Marker Quota

Only custom markers you define through the SDK will count towards your marker quota. Gamebeast automatically sends a number of default markers to track generic player interactions, such as player joins, leaves, and chats, but **these do not count towards your quota**.

While there is no hard rate limits on how often you can send markers, Gamebeast has a quota system in place to prevent abuse. If you exceed your quota, markers will be dropped until your quota resets, or you increase your quota through the project's billing page.

It's important to be mindful of how many markers you are sending to Gamebeast to avoid hitting your quota. You can view a usage graph of your markers in the Gamebeast dashboard to help you understand how close you are to your quota.
