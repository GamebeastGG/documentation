# Engagement Markers

Markers are used to track player interactions and events in your experience. This data can be used to create heatmaps and other visualizations to help you understand how players are interacting with your experience.

To send markers to Gamebeast, you must first fetch the [`Markers`](/Roblox/API/Markers) service from the Gamebeast SDK. You can then use the provided `:SendMarker` methods to send markers to Gamebeast with your custom data.

By default, Gamebeast also sends a number of built-in markers to track generic player interactions, such as player joins, leaves, and chats.

### Visualizing Markers
Marker data can be visualized in the Gamebeast dashboard. You can view graphs of player interactions, as well as a list of all markers sent to Gamebeast.
