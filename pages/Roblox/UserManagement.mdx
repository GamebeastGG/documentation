# Viewing User Details

To view a user's details, click on the three dots to the right of the user's name in the user list. This will open a page with the user's details where you can see their user ID, currency spent in experience, total playtime, and more. 

Below the user details, you can see a list of events that the user has triggered in the experience. This includes any default SDK markers and custom markers that you have sent to Gamebeast.
