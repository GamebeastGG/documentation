# SDK Services

All gamebeast services must be fetched through the `:GetService` method of the Gamebeast module.

```lua filename="server-markers.lua" copy numbered
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Gamebeast = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Gamebeast"))

local GamebeastMarkers = Gamebeast:GetService("Markers")
```

Types for each service are available directly through the Gamebeast module and can optionally be casted onto the returned service module.

```lua
local GamebeastMarkers = Gamebeast:GetService("Markers") :: Gamebeast.MarkersService
```

*Some* services can only be accessed on the server or client, but not both, such as the `Markers` service. Look for these icons at the top of the documentation page to understand where a service can be used:
<RunContext contexts={["server", "client"]} />
