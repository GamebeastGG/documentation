# Remote Configurations

Remote configurations make it easy to update and tune values in real-time across all your game servers without shutting down on
users, allowing for uninterrupted engagement.

## Creating a configuration profile
These configurations are managed in the Gamebeast dashboard via "configuration profiles". To create a new configuration profile,
simply navigate to the "Configurations" tab of the nav bar on the dashboard and press "Add Configuration". This will create a
blank configuration profile.

Each element you define in your profile can be one of 4 types: a primitive, an array, an object, or a link.

**Primitive**: The Primitive type allows for any raw value such as a number, a string, or boolean. Type is inferred based on your input.
Ensure you both enter the value correctly and that you're receiving them correctly where you're developing.

**Array**: The Array type allows for an array of primitive values.

**Object**: An object behaves like a dictionary, allowing you to place more values within that key, which can include other dictionaries.
After creating an object, you can add elements by hovering over any of the immediate value and pressing the "+" button that appears.

**Link**: A link is symbolic link which instead of being a raw value points to a different configuration profile. This makes it easy
to organize different profiles and conceptualize them as "modules" within a main organizational configuration profile.

To select a type, hover over the "#" and click the type you would like to use.

### Importing Roblox modules or existing configurations

By pressing the "Import JSON File" button, you can create a new configuration profile from a JSON file. This makes it easy to
import configurations from another project or migrate your Roblox modules to Gamebeast after turning them to valid JSON files.
That process can be done with the following code:

```lua
local httpService = game:GetService("HttpService")

local data = {
    ["Sizes"] = {
        ["Jimbo"] = {
            ["SizeMulti"] = 1
        }
    }
}

local encoded = httpService:JSONEncode(data)
print(encoded)
-- copy output to a file and upload
```

**Note: Be aware that Roblox userdata types (Enums, NumberRange, Color3, etc.) and anything else not JSON serializable will be null with
this code.** Consider modifying the code to convert your data to a serializable representation that you can then use in a profile.

## Target environments (modes)
For our Roblox solution, the top "Studio Mode" selector determines whether your changes are made to your live game servers or
Roblox Studio. When enabled, changing configurations, user management actions, and recorded marker and analytics data only affects
and is only for when running your game in Roblox Studio. This makes testing your game and changes to configurations easy without
deploying to your live servers. Conversely, any actions taken with "Studio Mode" disabled will publish to and affect your live
servers.

## Publishing configurations
Once you've created a configuration profile, you can then select the "Current configuration" for your project. This is the profile
that will be used across all your game servers. Note that confirming the selection will publish that configuration to the current
environment.
Following the initial selection and publication of your configurations, you can edit the profile directly and click the green
save icon to publish to the current environment.
You can the status of your publish action under the "Jobs" tab. For more on the Jobs page, see [here](https://docs.gamebeast.gg/Roblox/Jobs).
