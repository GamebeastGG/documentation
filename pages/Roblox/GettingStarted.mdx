# Getting Started
Getting started with Gamebeast in Roblox is easy. To add the SDK, you'll first need to install the Gamebeast plugin for Roblox Studio, which can be found [here](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15951241108/Gamebeast%3Fkeyword=&pageNumber=&pagePosition=). After downloading, the plugin should appear under "Gamebeast" in the Plugins tab of Roblox Studio.

Next, Click the Add/Update SDK button to automatically add our Roblox SDK and Gamebeast module to ReplicatedStorage. You will be prompted to give the plugin permission to insert scripts into your experience, select "Allow".

To make sure your Gamebeast plugin always functions properly, navigate to the Plugins tab of Roblox Studio, click "Manage Plugins", and enable the "Auto Update" option for Gamebeast.

When you open an experience in Roblox Studio that contains the Gamebeast SDK, the plugin will automatically output a warning if your SDK is out of date. Simply click the plugin to update your SDK. 

Finally, in Roblox Studio, go to the Home tab and press the "Game Settings" buttons. Under the "Security" tab, enable the "Allow HTTP Requests" and "Enabled Studio Access to API Services" options. This allows the Gamebeast SDK to communicate with the dashboard and use Roblox services for different features.
