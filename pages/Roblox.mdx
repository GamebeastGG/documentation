# Roblox SDK

Use this section to review required setup functions and examples for the Roblox SDK.

Refer to the [Getting started](/Roblox/GettingStarted) section for a for installation information.

## Calling into Gamebeast from Roblox

```lua filename="server.lua" copy numbered
-- Server Script
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Gamebeast = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Gamebeast"))
 
Gamebeast:Setup({
    key = "abcd-efgh-1234-5678",
})
```

```lua filename="client.lua" copy numbered
-- Client Script
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Gamebeast = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Gamebeast"))
 
Gamebeast:Setup({})
```

## SDK Usage Considerations

#### Do not clear the `shared` global table.

Gamebeast's Roblox SDK uses `shared.GBMod` to fetch modules within its internal framework. Clearing this table will result in the SDK erroring during startup.
It's okay to add additional entries to `shared` as long as GBMod is not overwritten.

#### It is unsafe to change the SDK's source.

The SDK is designed to be a black box, modifying its source code can lead to unexpected behavior. 
Changes will not be preserved when the plugin updates the SDK. 
If you're interested in additional functionality, please reach out.


## SDK Methods

```lua
local Gamebeast = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Gamebeast"))
```

## `:Setup(markerType, value, position)` 

This function must be called once on the server and client to initialize the Gamebeast SDK.
Attempting to call any other SDK method before calling `:Setup` will result in an error.

### Parameters

- `setupConfig : ClientSetupConfig | ServerSetupConfig`: The required config table for the SDK.

### Types

```luau
type SDKSettings = {
	-- Enables SDK warnings for API misuse, internal errors, etc.
	sdkWarningsEnabled : boolean,
	-- Enables stack trace inclusion with warning messages.
	includeWarningStackTrace : boolean,
}
type ServerSetupConfig = {
	key : string | Secret,
	sdkSettings : SDKSettings?
}

type ClientSetupConfig = {
	sdkSettings : SDKSettings?
}
```

### Usage
```lua
-- Server
Gamebeast:Setup({
    key = "abcd-efgh-1234-5678",
    sdkSettings = {
        sdkWarningsEnabled = true,
        includeWarningStackTrace = false,
    }
})

-- Client
Gamebeast:Setup({
    sdkSettings = {
        sdkWarningsEnabled = true,
        includeWarningStackTrace = false,
    }
})
```

## `:GetService(serviceName)`
This method will attempt to fetch a service module from the Gamebeast SDK.
All available services can be found documented [here.](/Roblox/API)

### Parameters

- `serviceName : string`: The name of the service.

### Usage
```lua
GamebeastMarkers = Gamebeast:GetService("Markers") :: Gamebeast.MarkersService
```
