# Getting Started
Getting started with Gamebeast in Roblox is easy. To add the SDK, you'll first need to add it to your Roblox inventory by pressing the "Get Model" button [here](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15950975837/GamebeastSDK%3Fkeyword=&pageNumber=&pagePosition=).

Next, install the Gamebeast plugin for Roblox Studio, which can be found here. After downloading, the plugin should appear under "Gamebeast" in the Plugins tab of Roblox Studio.

Click the Add/Update SDK button to automatically add our Roblox SDK and Gamebeast module to ServerScriptService and ReplicatedStorage respectively. You will be prompted to give the plugin permission to insert scripts into your experience, select "Allow".

If you have an existing SDK in ServerScriptService, the plugin will preserve your Keys module and EventCode folder, which hold your Gamebeast keys and live event code respectively.
To make sure your Gamebeast plugin always functions properly, navigate to the Plugins tab of Roblox Studio, click "Manage Plugins", and enable the "Auto Update" option for Gamebeast.

When you open an experience in Roblox Studio that contains the Gamebeast SDK, the plugin will automatically output a warning if your SDK is out of date. Simply click the plugin to update your SDK.
