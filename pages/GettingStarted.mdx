# Getting Started

The Gamebeast SDK is designed to be a familiar and easy-to-integrate tool for developers. 
Once integrated, you can access the Gamebeast dashboard to monitor and manage your game's performance, manage users, and more.

## Accessing the Gamebeast Dashboard

The Gamebeast dashboard can be found [here.](https://gamebeast.gg/).

To create a new project, follow these steps:
1. Sign in with your Gamebeast account or create a new one. 
2. Once signed in, press the `+` tile to create a new project underneath your organization.
3. Name your project, then on the SDK dropdown, select the platform you're using and press `Create`.
4. You will be redirected to the project settings page where you can access the SDK API key and other project settings.

## Installation

Getting started with Gamebeast in your experience is easy, and only requires a few steps. To install the SDK and start getting data from your experience, check out the guides below:
- [Roblox Installation](/Roblox/Installation)

## Studio Mode

After you've finished signing up and setting up your SDK, your project may be in studio mode. Studio mode is a feature that allows you to test new configurations and data without it affecting live game servers.

To enable or disable studio mode, click the `Studio Mode` toggle in the top right of the Gamebeast dashboard. To identify if studio mode is enabled, look for a purple border at the top of the gamebeast dashboard.
