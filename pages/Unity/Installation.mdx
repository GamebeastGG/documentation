# Installation
Getting started with Gamebeast in Unity is easy. This guide will walk you through the process of installing the Gamebeast SDK and configuring your API key.

If you haven't created a project in the Gamebeast dashboard yet, please start with the [Getting Started](/GettingStarted) guide.

## Installing the SDK

The Unity SDK is currently available directly from our [GitHub](https://github.com/GamebeastGG/UnitySDK) and can be added to your Unity project.

Gamebeast will soon be available on the Unity Asset Store for easier installation.

## Start the SDK and Configure API Key
The next step of getting your data on the Gamebeast dashboard is to start the SDK and configure your API key.

To start the SDK, you'll need to add the following code to a script in your project:

```cs filename="gamebeast_setup.cs" copy numbered
using UnityEngine;
using Gamebeast.Runtime;

public class GamebeastStarter : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        GamebeastSdk.Init("abcd-efgh-1234-5678");
    }
}
```

### Creating an API key
Next, we'll need to configure the API key for your project.

To do this, we'll need to go back to the project settings page on the dashboard.

1. Navigate to the project settings page by clicking "Project Settings" on the left side of the dashboard.
2. Create a new API key by pressing the "Create API Key" button.
3. Copy the API key before closing the popup. **Make sure to hold onto this because you won't be able to see it again!**
4. In the Unity script, replace the placeholder key with the API key you just created.

```cs
GamebeastSdk.Init("abcd-efgh-1234-5678"); // Replace with your API key.
```

And that's it! You're now ready to start sending data to the Gamebeast dashboard.
